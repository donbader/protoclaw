## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 6 phases following dependency graph (tooling → leaf → managers → SDK → tests → decomposition)
- Roadmap: BUGF-01/BUGF-02 are cross-cutting — fixed opportunistically in every phase
- [Phase 01]: deny.toml advisories uses cargo-deny 0.19.x defaults instead of per-severity fields
- [Phase 01]: CI coverage floor set at 70% (5% below 75.17% baseline)
- [Phase 02]: DeliverMessage.content stays Value — agents manager mutates raw JSON (timestamps, normalization, command injection)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 may need deeper research on ACP protocol message shapes before typing them (flagged by research)
